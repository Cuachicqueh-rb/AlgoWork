# Algo Trading and Blockchain Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects related to algorithmic trading and blockchain. Please note that due to proprietary considerations, I am unable to upload the complete code for certain projects. However, I've provided descriptions and overviews of the work done, along with the available code snippets and tools.

Algorithmic Trading
Pair Trading Strategy with Kalman Filter
The Pair_Trade folder contains a comprehensive backtesting framework for a statistical arbitrage strategy utilizing the Kalman filter. This strategy aims to identify pairs of tickers that exhibit cointegration and then implements a Kalman filter to predict potential price movements. The backtesting module assesses the performance of this strategy over historical data and provides valuable insights into its profitability and risk.

Mean Reversion Backtesting
Explore the Mean-reversion folder to find a work-in-progress backtesting framework centered around mean reversion strategies. Although the codebase might not be complete, the provided components can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in testing mean reversion strategies using historical data.

Blockchain
Incorporating blockchain technology into trading strategies and data analysis can offer unique advantages. The blockchain-related work in this repository involves query tools and techniques that can be integrated into various strategies.

Please note that while I've provided extensive information about these projects, some of the coding work remains proprietary and thus cannot be shared on GitHub. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about these projects, feel free to get in touch via email or other communication channels.
